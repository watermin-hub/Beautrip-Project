    category: "Recovery Guide",
    content: `## Facial Contour Surgery (Bone-Restructuring Procedures)

Recommended recovery period: At least 1 month

(Included procedures: V-line reduction, mandibular shaving, bone contouring, chin surgery, chin reduction, cortical osteotomy, masseter reduction injection/surgery, non-incisional chin contouring, double-chin muscle tightening, mandibular surgery, maxillary surgery, double-jaw surgery, chin implant insertion, chin implant removal, chin foreign body removal)

## 🕐 Week 1 (Post-op Days 0–7)

### The stage when the body most strongly senses that the facial bones have moved

These procedures involve repositioning the bones themselves, not just the skin or soft tissue, which is why the body's response is particularly intense. During this week, discomfort is not limited to the surgical site; swelling, numbness, tightness, and pain across the entire face are all normal. Because the muscles, skin, and nerves above the bones have not yet adapted to their new positions, the face may appear much more swollen, wider, or squarer than the final result. This appearance represents the beginning of recovery and is not the final outcome.

✔ Helpful tips for this week

- Minimize your schedule and prioritize recovery above all else
- Sleep with your head elevated to help reduce swelling
- Take short, gentle walks indoors or in hallways for 3–5 minutes several times a day
- Follow hospital instructions precisely for cold and warm compresses

⚠ What to avoid this week

- Frequently checking the mirror to judge facial width or contour
- Forcing outings or long periods of activity
- Assuming pain or swelling means something went wrong

## 🕑 Week 2 (Post-op Days 8–14)

### Major swelling decreases and the new contour direction begins to emerge

From this week, the most severe swelling gradually subsides and the face begins to feel slightly smaller. However, this is a transitional phase in which major swelling decreases while minor swelling remains, making differences between morning and evening very common. This is a normal recovery pattern after jaw and contour surgery, not a sign of poor healing. At this stage, it is enough to observe the overall direction of contour change rather than focusing on fine details.

✔ Helpful tips for this week

- Plan short outings where you can sit and rest
- Take photos only for record-keeping under the same lighting and angles
- Support circulation and swelling reduction with light walks

⚠ What to avoid this week

- Excessive comparison with pre-surgery photos or others' recovery cases
- Drinking alcohol or staying up late
- Becoming anxious simply because swelling remains

## 🕒 Week 3 (Post-op Days 15–21)

### Externally natural, while internal adjustment continues

By this point, most people around you will find your appearance natural, but you may still feel soreness or fatigue in the jaw or cheeks after talking or smiling a lot. This reflects ongoing muscle and joint adaptation and is a normal part of recovery, not a setback.

✔ Helpful tips for this week

- Light travel or photo sessions are generally possible
- Intentionally include rest periods throughout the day
- Reducing your schedule on particularly tiring days is part of recovery

⚠ What to avoid this week

- Intense exercise or activities that heavily strain the jaw
- Overexerting yourself under the assumption that recovery is complete

## 🕓 Week 4 (Post-op Days 22–28)

### Daily life is mostly normal, but internal stabilization is ongoing

Work, social activities, and general travel are usually manageable at this stage. Medically, however, full bone stabilization takes 3–6 months, meaning your current appearance represents a stable recovery phase rather than the final result.

✔ Helpful tips for this week

- Begin light exercise within your doctor's approved range
- Compare your current appearance with photos from weeks 1 and 2
- Rest promptly when you feel signs of fatigue

⚠ What to avoid this week

- Drawing final conclusions at week four
- Interpreting lingering discomfort as a failed result

### Medical note

Recovery after facial contour and double-jaw surgery is about sequence, not speed. As long as you continue appropriate care for each stage, results naturally follow in the next phase.`,

Recommended Recovery Period: 3–4 weeks

(Included procedures: zygoma reduction, anterior zygoma reduction, lateral zygoma reduction, full zygoma reduction, quick zygoma reduction, zygoma implant insertion, anterior zygoma implant insertion, temple implant insertion, temple reduction, forehead implant insertion, forehead reduction, brow bone reduction, occipital implant insertion, zygoma foreign body removal, temple foreign body removal, forehead foreign body removal, facial contour revision surgery)

## 🕐 Week 1 (Day 0–7)

### The phase when the body strongly senses changes in the upper face and head structure

These procedures affect not only the front of the face but also the sides and upper contours, including the head shape. Even if only one area is treated, the body recognizes a structural change to the entire face and head. Tightness in the upper face, a heavy helmet-like sensation, and pulling discomfort when turning the head or chewing are common. The face may appear wider or the contours more pronounced than the final outcome, which is a normal response before tissues and fascia adapt.

✔ Helpful tips

- Keep the head slightly elevated without excessive height
- Avoid touching or pressing the contours
- Rest indoors and minimize stimulation
- Follow hospital instructions precisely for cold and warm compresses

⚠ What to avoid

- Frequently evaluating facial width or forehead size in the mirror
- Wearing tight hats that compress the face
- Exaggerated facial expressions
- Becoming overly anxious about temporary changes

## 🕑 Week 2 (Day 8–14)

### Swelling subsides and the direction of contour refinement becomes noticeable

From week two, inflammation gradually decreases and overall facial volume reduces. Swelling may shift between areas, making some days the cheekbones appear more prominent and other days the forehead or temples fuller. While the front view may still seem wide, side and 45-degree angles often show improved depth. At this stage, confirming the general direction of refinement is sufficient.

✔ Helpful tips

- Plan outings where you can sit and rest
- Take photos under consistent lighting and angles for reference
- Stay well hydrated to support circulation

⚠ What to avoid

- Daily detailed comparison of contours
- Strong sun exposure, saunas, or steam rooms
- Impatience due to residual swelling

## 🕒 Week 3 (Day 15–21)

### Others begin to notice changes before you do

By week three, most visible swelling has resolved and others may comment that your face looks smaller or softer. Temporary stiffness or fatigue after busy days or frequent facial movement is a normal part of adaptation.

✔ Helpful tips

- Light travel or photo schedules are manageable
- Include rest breaks during long days
- Use hairstyles to naturally balance contours
- Record changes in natural light

⚠ What to avoid

- Prolonged exaggerated expressions
- Late nights or alcohol that can trigger swelling
- Neglecting care due to feeling fully healed

## 🕓 Week 4 (Day 22–28)

### Appears natural externally while internal structures continue stabilizing

By week four, daily activities are comfortable and surgical signs are subtle. However, stabilization of bone, fascia, and soft tissue continues for 3–6 months. The current appearance represents a stable intermediate stage rather than the final result.

✔ Helpful tips

- Resume normal routines
- Begin light walking and stretching
- Plan evaluation around the three-month mark
- Rest promptly when fatigue arises

⚠ What to avoid

- Starting contour or lymphatic massage too early
- Overanalyzing minor asymmetries
- Considering the one-month appearance as the final result

### Medical guidance

Facial contour revision prioritizes steady stabilization over rapid visible change. Maintaining appropriate care at each stage supports a smoother, more natural outcome over time.`,

      "A guide to the recovery process for procedures that change the facial center axis, including nasal surgery, non-incisional nose correction, and nose treatments.",
    category: "Recovery Guide",
    content: `## Nasal Surgery · Non-Incisional Procedures · Nose Treatments

Recommended Recovery Period: 2–4 weeks

(Included procedures: nasal bridge augmentation, rib/ear cartilage rhinoplasty, artificial implant rhinoplasty, nasal tip extension, columella extension, hump correction, thread lift rhinoplasty, comprehensive rhinoplasty, high-bridge nose, upturned nose shaping, filler rhinoplasty, botox alar reduction)

## 🕐 Week 1 (Day 0–7)

### The phase when changes to the facial center cause the strongest bodily response

The nose sits at the center of the face and is closely linked to breathing, speech, and facial expression, so even small changes can trigger strong physical reactions. During this phase, swelling, tightness, pressure, and a foreign-body sensation are common, making the nose appear larger or less defined than the final outcome. Whether surgical or non-surgical, early stimulation can exaggerate nasal lines—this is a normal initial response, not the final result.

✔ Helpful tips

- Sleep on your back and avoid pressing your face into the pillow
- Stay well hydrated to prevent nasal dryness
- Follow cleansing, medication, and heat-care instructions exactly
- Limit outings and prioritize indoor rest

⚠ What to avoid

- Touching or squeezing the nose to check shape
- Tight mask pressure
- Hot foods, alcohol, or overheating
- Judging results based solely on immediate photos

## 🕑 Week 2 (Day 8–14)

### Swelling decreases and the direction of nasal contours becomes clearer

By week two, early redness and swelling gradually subside, and changes become noticeable from both front and side views. Surgical procedures may still feel firm or tight, while non-surgical results often appear clearer. Swelling can shift between areas day to day, which is a normal part of recovery.

✔ Helpful tips

- Reduce mask pressure except in crowded places
- Short, light outings such as cafés or walks
- Take photos in natural light from front and 45-degree angles
- Use only prescribed products for internal dryness

⚠ What to avoid

- Pressing the bridge or tip to check shape
- Sun exposure, saunas, or steam rooms
- Overreacting to temporary unevenness

## 🕒 Week 3 (Day 15–21)

### The nose begins to blend naturally with the rest of the face

By week three, discomfort during smiling or speaking lessens, and the nose starts to harmonize with overall facial features. Social activities, photos, and light travel are usually comfortable, though mild tightness may appear on busy days—this is part of normal adaptation.

✔ Helpful tips

- Photography and travel schedules are manageable
- Slightly higher camera angles often look more natural
- Gradually resume light makeup
- Maintain sun protection around the nose

⚠ What to avoid

- Accidental impact in crowded spaces
- Alcohol or late nights that may trigger swelling
- Stopping aftercare too early

## 🕓 Week 4 (Day 22–28)

### Appears stable externally while internal tissues continue adapting

By week four, the nose looks natural in most situations, but cartilage, soft tissue, and skin continue adjusting for up to 3–6 months. The current appearance represents a stable intermediate phase rather than the final outcome.

✔ Helpful tips

- Normal daily life, travel, and flights are generally fine
- Plan photo comparisons around the three-month mark
- Maintain a low-irritation lifestyle
- Continue moisturizing if dryness or tightness remains

⚠ What to avoid

- Nasal massage or strong pressure
- Fixating on minor height or angle differences
- Treating the one-month result as final

### Medical guidance

Recovery after nasal procedures often includes emotional ups and downs. As long as stage-appropriate care is maintained, the nose will continue to harmonize naturally with the face over time.`,

      "A guide to the recovery process for procedures where the eyes react to subtle changes in muscle and skin structure, including double eyelid surgery, eye shape correction, epicanthoplasty, and eye revision surgery.",
    category: "Recovery Guide",
    content: `## Eye Surgery · Epicanthoplasty · Revision Procedures

Recommended Recovery Period: 2–4 weeks

(Included procedures: full-incision double eyelid surgery, non-incisional double eyelid surgery, eyelid revision, comprehensive eye surgery, upper eyelid lift, under-eye bag removal, inner corner incision, outer corner incision, lower eyelid repositioning, combined epicanthoplasty, eye revision surgery)

## 🕐 Week 1 (Day 0–7)

### The phase when the eyes react most sensitively to subtle changes in muscle and skin

The eye area has thin skin and highly active facial muscles, making it especially sensitive to change. During this phase, swelling, bruising, tightness, and heaviness are common, and the eyes may appear larger or more elevated than the final outcome. Full-incision or revision procedures can make lines look pronounced due to tension, while corner incisions may cause a pulling sensation. These appearances are a normal part of early recovery.

✔ Helpful tips

- Minimize forceful eye opening or frowning
- Sleep with the head slightly elevated to reduce swelling
- Apply cold compresses only as instructed and for short durations
- Prioritize indoor rest

⚠ What to avoid

- Rubbing the eyes or pressing on eyelid lines
- Prolonged screen time
- Heavy eye makeup
- Judging results based on immediate postoperative photos

## 🕑 Week 2 (Day 8–14)

### Swelling decreases and the direction of eyelid shape becomes clearer

By week two, major swelling and bruising subside, and eyelid lines and shape corrections become more noticeable. Heaviness in the morning with improvement by afternoon is a common daily pattern. Pulling sensations from corner incisions also gradually ease.

✔ Helpful tips

- Assess recovery based on afternoon appearance
- Take record photos in natural light from the front
- Use prescribed eye drops and ointments consistently
- Short, light outings are acceptable

⚠ What to avoid

- Daily comparison of left and right eyelids
- Saunas, steam rooms, or excessive sweating
- Impatience due to temporary unevenness

## 🕒 Week 3 (Day 15–21)

### The eye area begins to blend naturally with the face

By week three, swelling is largely resolved and the eyes appear softer in photos and videos. Eyelid lines move more naturally with blinking, and surgical adjustments harmonize with overall facial features. Mild swelling or tightness may still appear on tiring days.

✔ Helpful tips

- Photo shoots and social plans are manageable
- Gradually resume light eye makeup
- Ensure adequate sleep to prevent swelling recurrence
- Evaluate changes based on overall facial balance

⚠ What to avoid

- Excessive facial expression exercises
- Alcohol or late nights
- Discontinuing aftercare too early

## 🕓 Week 4 (Day 22–28)

### Appears stable externally while internal tissues continue adapting

By week four, the eye area looks stable, but internal tissues—especially after full-incision or revision surgery—may take 3–6 months to fully settle. The current appearance represents a transitional stage, not the final result.

✔ Helpful tips

- Daily life and travel are generally comfortable
- Maintain sun protection and hydration around the eyes
- Plan progress evaluation around the three-month mark
- Rest promptly when fatigue appears

⚠ What to avoid

- Starting eye-area massage or lymphatic techniques too early
- Fixating on minor asymmetries
- Treating the one-month appearance as final

### Medical guidance

Recovery from eye surgery is achieved through gradual, cumulative changes. Consistent care at each stage supports a more natural and stable long-term result.`,

Recommended Recovery Period: 2–3 weeks

(Included procedures: orbital fat repositioning, under-eye bag removal, tear trough fat grafting, tear trough correction, dark circle fat grafting, under-eye implant, hyaluronic acid tear trough filler)

## 🕐 Week 1 (Day 0–7)

### The phase when thin skin and vascular changes trigger the strongest response

The lower eyelid has some of the thinnest skin on the face and a dense network of blood vessels and fat. As a result, even minor stimulation can cause noticeable changes in color and volume. During this phase, swelling, bruising, and tightness are common, and dark circles may appear darker or puffiness more pronounced than the final result. After fat repositioning or grafting, unevenness or asymmetry may be noticeable, which is a normal response before tissues settle.

✔ Helpful tips

- Apply cold compresses briefly and only as instructed
- Limit eye strain and prioritize rest
- Sleep with the head slightly elevated to reduce swelling
- Use artificial tears to prevent dryness

⚠ What to avoid

- Pressing the lower eyelids to check shape
- Prolonged screen time
- Heavy eye makeup
- Judging results based solely on bruising or color

## 🕑 Week 2 (Day 8–14)

### Color tone and volume begin to separate and clarify

By week two, bruising and major swelling subside, allowing clearer distinction between under-eye color and fullness. Dark circles may start to appear brighter, while fat-related procedures show smoother contours. Temporary darkening in the morning or evening can occur due to circulation changes and is part of normal recovery.

✔ Helpful tips

- Short outings or light photo sessions are manageable
- Take record photos in natural light from the front
- Maintain moisturization and sun protection
- Assess progress based on afternoon appearance

⚠ What to avoid

- Daily close comparison of color changes
- Saunas or steam rooms
- Sleep deprivation

## 🕒 Week 3 (Day 15–21)

### The under-eye area begins to blend naturally with the face

By week three, the lower eyelids integrate more naturally with overall facial features, reducing a tired appearance in photos and videos. Makeup usage often decreases. Mild swelling or color fluctuation may still occur on particularly busy days, which remains within the normal recovery range.

✔ Helpful tips

- Daily life and travel are generally comfortable
- Gradually resume light makeup
- Prioritize sleep and hydration
- Compare progress on a monthly basis

⚠ What to avoid

- Alcohol or late nights
- Starting eye-area massage too early
- Discontinuing aftercare

## 🕓 Week 4 (Day 22–28)

### Appears stable externally while subtle changes continue

By week four, the appearance is largely stable, but fat survival and vascular tone adjustments can continue for 3–6 months. The current result represents a transitional stage rather than the final outcome.

✔ Helpful tips

- Maintain a consistent daily routine
- Continue moisturizing and sun protection
- Plan progress evaluation around the three-month mark
- Rest promptly when fatigue appears

⚠ What to avoid

- Overanalyzing minor asymmetries
- Treating the one-month appearance as final
- Making impulsive decisions for additional procedures

### Medical guidance

Improvements in the under-eye area can have a significant impact on overall facial impression. With consistent stage-appropriate care, results tend to become brighter and more refined over time.`,

    category: "Recovery Guide",
    content: `## Eye Area Volume Treatments · Tear Trough · Periorbital Fillers

Recommended Recovery Period: 1–2 weeks

*(May vary depending on injection type and volume)*

## 🕐 Week 1 (Day 0–7)

### A period when the delicate eye area reacts sensitively to volume changes

The skin around the eyes is thin and highly reactive, so even small volume adjustments can feel more noticeable than expected. During this week, mild swelling, bruising, or a sense of fullness may appear around the tear trough or under-eye area. Right after treatment, the area can look slightly overfilled or uneven, but this is usually temporary and part of the natural settling process.

From a medical perspective, this stage is when the filler is integrating with surrounding tissue and drawing moisture. The appearance you see now is **not the final result**, and judging symmetry or volume at this point is not recommended.

✔ Helpful tips

- Keep the eye area clean and avoid unnecessary touching
- Sleep with your head slightly elevated to reduce swelling
- Observe changes every few days rather than day by day
- Use cold compresses only if advised by your clinic

⚠ What to avoid

- Pressing, massaging, or checking the area repeatedly
- Comparing left and right sides too closely in the mirror
- Making early decisions about correction or additional treatment

## 🕑 Week 2 (Day 8–14)

### Volume begins to settle and the eye area looks more balanced

By the second week, swelling and bruising usually decrease noticeably, and the volume around the eyes starts to blend more naturally with the rest of the face. The tear trough appears smoother, and the overall eye area looks less tired. Minor asymmetries often resolve on their own during this phase.

This is the appropriate time to evaluate the result **as a whole**, rather than focusing on small details. From a clinical standpoint, most fillers reach a stable state around this period.

✔ Helpful tips

- Review results under consistent lighting and conditions
- Maintain hydration and basic skincare around the eyes
- Contact your clinic if discomfort or unevenness persists
- Think in terms of overall impression, not millimeter differences

⚠ What to avoid

- Self-judging the result too strictly
- Scheduling additional injections too soon
- Using home beauty devices around the eye area

### Medical team note

Eye area volume treatments are designed to create subtle, natural improvement rather than dramatic change. **Allowing enough time for the filler to settle is part of the treatment itself.** When managed with patience, results tend to look softer and more harmonious with your facial expressions.`,

## 🕐 Week 1 (Day 0–7)

### The phase when the body most strongly senses that the face has become "rounder"

Even when only one area is treated, the body recognizes a change to the overall facial structure. During this phase, both treated and surrounding areas may swell, making the face appear rounder, fuller, or more protruded than the final outcome. Swelling, heaviness, tightness, and pressure are normal, and asymmetry or unevenness may be more noticeable. This is a temporary stage before fat stabilization begins.

✔ Helpful tips

- Avoid prolonged downward head positions
- Sleep with the head slightly elevated to reduce swelling
- Follow cold-compress instructions exactly as prescribed
- Limit outings and prioritize indoor rest

⚠ What to avoid

- Touching the face to check fullness
- Exaggerated facial expressions or intense laughter
- Judging outcomes based on the first few postoperative days

## 🕑 Week 2 (Day 8–14)

### Injected fat spreads and facial proportions begin to settle

From week two, major swelling subsides and the grafted fat begins to integrate with surrounding tissue. Areas like the forehead, temples, and cheekbones often stabilize sooner, while nasolabial folds and the mouth area may take longer. Temporary fluctuations—appearing reduced one day and fuller another—are part of normal absorption and survival processes.

✔ Helpful tips

- Take record photos in natural light from front and 45-degree angles
- Gradually resume light makeup
- Stay well hydrated to support circulation
- Assess progress based on afternoon appearance

⚠ What to avoid

- Facial massage or beauty devices
- Close mirror inspection
- Overanalyzing daily minor changes

## 🕒 Week 3 (Day 15–21)

### Facial features soften and grafted volume looks more natural

By week three, excessive fullness diminishes and overall facial harmony improves. Contours around the cheeks, folds, and mouth appear smoother, often reducing a tired look. Mild firmness or small lumps may still be felt and are common during healing.

✔ Helpful tips

- Photo shoots, dates, and regular work are manageable
- Gradually return to normal makeup routines
- Perform only gentle, brief facial stretching
- Prioritize sleep to support fat survival

⚠ What to avoid

- Strong pressure massage
- Sudden weight loss
- Stopping aftercare prematurely

## 🕓 Week 4 (Day 22–28)

### Appears stable, but it is still too early for final evaluation

By week four, the appearance is largely natural, but final fat survival is typically assessed around the three-month mark. The current result is well balanced, with further natural refinement expected over time.

✔ Helpful tips

- Daily life, travel, and filming are generally comfortable
- Continue sun protection and moisturization
- Maintain stable body weight
- Plan final photo comparison around three months

⚠ What to avoid

- Early massage or high-frequency beauty devices
- Fixating on minor asymmetry
- Treating the one-month appearance as final

### Medical guidance

Facial fat grafting requires time to settle and integrate. Maintaining the current recovery course supports a more balanced and natural facial appearance in the months ahead.`,

Recommended Recovery Period: 2–4 weeks

(Included procedures: facelift, mini facelift, SMAS lift, neck lift, thread lift, MINT thread lift, ultrasound lifting, Thermage, radiofrequency tightening, diamond lift, gold microneedling, titanium lift, RF lift, laser lifting, etc.)

## 🕐 Week 1 (Day 0–7)

### The phase when skin, fascia, and support structures are stimulated simultaneously

Surgical lifts, thread lifts, and energy-based treatments all apply traction, heat, or fixation changes to the skin and underlying tissue. During this phase, swelling, firmness, pulling sensations, and warmth are common. The face may appear more lifted than the final result, and expressions can feel unnatural. With energy-based treatments, internal tissue reactions may be active even if visible changes are subtle. This stage reflects the body recognizing stimulation and preparing for stabilization.

✔ Helpful tips

- Minimize facial expressions to allow muscles to rest
- Sleep with the head slightly elevated to reduce swelling
- Make sun protection and moisturization immediate habits
- Stay mostly indoors and avoid heat or irritation

⚠ What to avoid

- Touching the face to check tightness
- Saunas, steam rooms, or intense exercise
- Repeated mirror checks expecting instant results

## 🕑 Week 2 (Day 8–14)

### Tightness eases and the lifting direction becomes noticeable

By week two, significant swelling and heat sensations decrease, and the face begins to feel lighter. Thread lifts reveal fixation direction, while energy treatments show early improvements in skin texture. Variations in tightness between morning and evening are common during recovery. Focus on the direction of refinement rather than the degree of lift.

✔ Helpful tips

- Plan outings that allow seated rest
- Take record photos in natural light from front and 45-degree angles
- Increase moisturization compared to usual routines
- Evaluate progress based on afternoon appearance

⚠ What to avoid

- Daily detailed comparison of elasticity
- Impulsive decisions for additional treatments
- Aggressive cleansing or massage

## 🕒 Week 3 (Day 15–21)

### Facial appearance looks more refined and natural

By week three, others may notice a cleaner, more refreshed look. Fixation from surgery or threads stabilizes, and energy treatments often show improved firmness and texture. Mild tightness or fatigue after busy days is normal and part of adaptation.

✔ Helpful tips

- Photo shoots, dates, and short trips are manageable

    content: `## Face & Forehead Lift · Wrinkle Improvement Surgery

Recommended Recovery Period: 3–4 weeks

(Included procedures: facelift, mini lift, SMAS lift, midface lift, lower face lift, neck lift, forehead lift, brow lift, nasolabial fold release, marionette line release, wrinkle improvement surgery, revision procedures)

## 🕐 Week 1 (Day 0–7)

### The phase when skin and fascia are repositioned and the body reacts most strongly

These procedures adjust not only the skin surface but also the underlying fascia and soft tissue. During this phase, tightness, pressure, and heaviness are common, with sensations around the ears, scalp, and jawline. The face may appear overly lifted or firm due to fixation and swelling, which is a normal early response.

✔ Helpful tips

- Minimize talking and facial expressions
- Sleep with the head slightly elevated
- Wear compression garments or bandages as instructed
- Rest indoors and avoid stimulation

⚠ What to avoid

- Wide mouth opening
- Touching incisions around the ears or scalp
- Repeated mirror checks of lift degree

## 🕑 Week 2 (Day 8–14)

### Pulling eases while stiffness and numbness become more noticeable

By week two, strong traction subsides and stiffness, heaviness, or reduced sensation may remain. Forehead or brow lifts can feel heavy above the eyes, while mid-to-lower face work may cause numbness around the mouth or chin—both typical during adaptation.

✔ Helpful tips

- Short, light outings
- Soft foods eaten slowly
- Avoid prolonged downward head positions
- Assess recovery based on afternoon condition

⚠ What to avoid

- Facial massage or beauty devices
- Pressing incisions to "check" healing
- Daily comparison of wrinkle depth

## 🕒 Week 3 (Day 15–21)

### Contour refinement and wrinkle improvement become noticeable

By week three, nasolabial folds, marionette lines, and the jawline look cleaner, and others may comment on a brighter appearance. Mild stiffness during large expressions can persist and is part of normal healing.

✔ Helpful tips

- Photos, dates, and light travel are manageable
- Keep expressions natural
- Strengthen sun protection and moisturization
- Record changes in natural light

⚠ What to avoid

- Schedules requiring prolonged talking or laughter
- Late nights or alcohol
- Stopping aftercare too early

## 🕓 Week 4 (Day 22–28)

### Appears refined externally while internal stabilization continues

By week four, appearance is largely natural, but true stabilization of fascia and tissue takes **3–6 months**. This is a stable intermediate stage rather than the final result.

✔ Helpful tips

- Daily activities and outings are comfortable
- Resume exercise gradually with walking and stretching
- Make scar care a daily habit
- Review final changes around the three-month mark

⚠ What to avoid

- Early facial massage or high-frequency devices
- Fixating on minor wrinkles or asymmetry
- Treating the one-month result as final

    content: `## Breast · Accessory Breast · Gynecomastia Surgery

Recommended Recovery Period: 3–4 weeks

(Included procedures: breast implants, implant + fat grafting, autologous fat grafting, breast lift, lift with augmentation, breast reduction, implant removal, foreign body removal, revision surgery, accessory breast liposuction, accessory breast excision, Montgomery gland removal, nipple reduction, areola reduction, areola lightening, areola tattooing, inverted nipple correction, gynecomastia injection, gynecomastia excision)

## 🕐 Week 1 (Day 0–7)

### The phase when upper-body structure and center of gravity change most noticeably

Breast surgery affects the entire upper body—chest cage, underarms, shoulders, and back. Pain, pressure, heaviness, and pulling are common. After implants or lifts, the breasts may feel higher and firmer than expected. Combined accessory breast or gynecomastia procedures can intensify underarm pulling. This appearance is **temporary**, before tissues settle.

✔ Helpful tips

- Rest with the upper body slightly elevated
- Wear compression garments as directed
- Minimize arm movement; move slowly
- Walk briefly and often indoors to support circulation

⚠ What to avoid

- Raising arms overhead
- Lifting heavy luggage or bags
- Repeated mirror evaluation of breast shape

## 🕑 Week 2 (Day 8–14)

### Pain eases; heaviness and tightness become the main sensations

Sharp pain subsides, while heaviness and stiffness remain. Upper chest firmness after implants or lifts reflects natural settling. After reduction or gynecomastia surgery, the upper body may feel lighter but incisions more sensitive.

✔ Helpful tips

- Short outings with seated breaks
- Front-opening clothing; soft bras
- Use prescribed ointments only; avoid rubbing
- Plan based on afternoon comfort

⚠ What to avoid

- Underwire bras
- Arm-intensive shopping
- Daily comparison of scars or position

## 🕒 Week 3 (Day 15–21)

### Daily movements resume, with continued upper-body protection

Short outings are comfortable. Photos may look natural, while touch or movement can still feel unfamiliar. Clothing fit changes are often most noticeable after accessory breast or gynecomastia excision.

✔ Helpful tips

- Indoor activities or short-distance travel
- Choose routes with seating options
- Limit long photo sessions
- Use cushioned seating to reduce strain

⚠ What to avoid

- Jumping or upper-body strength training
- Shoulder-baring or tight compression garments
- Neglecting care due to early comfort

## 🕓 Week 4 (Day 22–28)

### Externally stable while internal tissues continue to settle

Most daily activities and travel are fine. Internal stabilization—implant position, fat graft take, skin adaptation—continues for **3–6 months**. This is a stable intermediate stage, not the final result.

✔ Helpful tips

- Resume normal routines; rest when fatigued
- Begin light cardio with medical approval
- Make scar care a daily habit
- Adjust plans to body signals

⚠ What to avoid

- Early swimming or high-intensity workouts
- Daily micro-scrutiny of shape
- Treating the one-month appearance as final

Recommended Recovery Period: 3–4 weeks

(Included procedures: abdominal liposuction, thigh liposuction, arm liposuction, back liposuction, flank liposuction, abdominal lift, lower abdominal lift, thigh lift, arm lift, hip lift, body contour revision, liposuction revision, lift revision)

## 🕐 Week 1 (Day 0–7)

### The phase when body volume and center of gravity shift, triggering the strongest response

Body liposuction and lift procedures affect overall balance and movement, not just a single area. Significant swelling, bruising, tenderness, and heaviness are common, and compression garments can make movement feel restricted. With lift procedures, even small posture changes may cause pulling or fatigue. The current contour is **temporary**, before tissues settle.

✔ Helpful tips

- Wear compression garments for the full prescribed duration
- Use cushions to avoid excessive folding at surgical sites when resting
- Move briefly and frequently indoors to support circulation
- Avoid overexertion even as pain decreases

⚠ What to avoid

- Removing compression garments without guidance
- Staying in one position for long periods
- Repeated mirror checks of body lines

## 🕑 Week 2 (Day 8–14)

### Major swelling subsides while firmness and tightness remain

Overall volume decreases, but firmness or uneven texture under the skin may persist as fat, skin, and fascia reposition. After abdominal, thigh, or arm lifts, tightness with movement is common and expected.

✔ Helpful tips

- Short outings with planned rest breaks
- Increase hydration to aid circulation
- Schedule activities based on afternoon comfort
- Ensure compression garments sit smoothly

⚠ What to avoid

- Aggressive self-massage
- Sauna or steam rooms
- Daily detailed comparison of contours

## 🕒 Week 3 (Day 15–21)

### The direction of body contour changes becomes noticeable

By week three, many notice changes in clothing fit. Liposuction areas begin to show overall contour direction, and lifted areas feel more supported. Prolonged standing or busy days may still bring heaviness.

✔ Helpful tips

- Track progress by clothing fit rather than scale weight
- Light walking and gentle stretching are acceptable
- Take breaks during long travel
- Photograph progress in consistent outfits and angles

⚠ What to avoid

- High-intensity cardio or strength training
- Long periods of standing for events or shoots
- Neglecting care due to early improvement

## 🕓 Week 4 (Day 22–28)

### Daily life resumes while contour stabilization continues

Most daily activities are comfortable by week four. However, full stabilization of skin and fat layers takes **3–6 months**. This stage represents ongoing refinement, not the final result.

✔ Helpful tips

- Resume exercise gradually with medical approval
- Adjust compression wear step by step
- Plan long-term body maintenance
- Rest promptly when fatigue appears

⚠ What to avoid

- Combining recovery with extreme dieting
- Early lymphatic massage or energy-based treatments
- Treating the one-month contour as final

Recommended Recovery Period: 3–4 weeks

(Included procedures: hip fat grafting, Brazilian butt lift (BBL), hip lift, hip implants, hip contour revision, pelvic contouring, pelvic fat grafting, hip revision surgery, fat graft revision)

## 🕐 Week 1 (Day 0–7)

### A phase that strongly affects sitting and standing, triggering clear body reactions

Hip and pelvic procedures directly affect daily movement. Swelling, pressure, heaviness, and tightness are common, especially after fat grafting, when sitting may feel compressive and standing may feel tight. The area can appear larger or uneven, which is **normal before fat and tissues settle**.

✔ Helpful tips

- Avoid prolonged sitting; use a donut cushion when needed
- Rest on your side or back to minimize pressure
- Walk briefly and often indoors
- Wear compression garments as instructed

⚠ What to avoid

- Sitting on hard surfaces for long periods
- Positions that heavily compress the hips
- Frequent mirror checks of shape

## 🕑 Week 2 (Day 8–14)

### Major swelling subsides and contour direction becomes clearer

Strong swelling gradually decreases, and the hip line becomes easier to assess. Swelling may fluctuate with activity or sitting time. After fat grafting, a sense of volume reduction can occur as absorption and stabilization happen simultaneously.

✔ Helpful tips

- Short outings with planned breaks
- Plan activities around standing and walking
- Maintain hydration to support circulation
- Record progress in consistent clothing and angles

⚠ What to avoid

- Early massage or roller use
- Long car rides
- Emotional reactions to daily size changes

## 🕒 Week 3 (Day 15–21)

### Movement feels easier and silhouette changes are more noticeable

Sitting and standing become more comfortable, and changes in how clothing fits are noticeable. Some firmness may remain to the touch as tissues continue to stabilize. Busy days can still cause tightness.

✔ Helpful tips

- Normal outings and short travel are manageable
- Evaluate progress by clothing fit
- Light stretching and walking are acceptable
- Take standing breaks during prolonged sitting

⚠ What to avoid

- Jumping or lower-body strength training
- Prolonged continuous sitting
- Stopping care due to early comfort

## 🕓 Week 4 (Day 22–28)

### Appearance stabilizes while fat graft take continues

By week four, appearance looks natural, but final fat graft retention is best assessed around **three months**. Minor asymmetry or texture differences typically continue to improve.

✔ Helpful tips

- Daily life and travel are comfortable
- Resume light exercise with medical approval
- Keep weight stable
- Plan a three-month comparison

⚠ What to avoid

- Early intense exercise
- Strong pressure or massage on the hips
- Treating the one-month appearance as final

Recommended recovery period: 1–2 weeks

*Recovery time may vary depending on treatment area, injection volume, and individual response.*

(Applicable treatments: Fat-Dissolving Injections, PPC Injections, HPL Injections, Contour Injections, Body Botox, Trapezius Botox, Calf Botox, Upper Arm Injections, Thigh Injections, Abdominal Fat-Dissolving Injections)

## 🕐 Week 1 (Day 0–7)

### The body begins reacting to stimulation in the fat and muscle layers

Even without incisions, injectable treatments directly affect the fat and muscle layers, and the body clearly recognizes this change. During this period, swelling, warmth, tenderness, and mild bruising around the injection sites are common. The treated areas may feel firm or uneven to the touch, which is a normal response as the medication spreads and begins to work within the tissue. The contour seen at this stage is temporary and does not represent the final outcome.

✔ Helpful tips

- Maintain adequate hydration to support metabolism and circulation
- Keep injection sites clean and avoid touching them unnecessarily
- Take short, gentle walks to encourage lymphatic flow
- Follow only the aftercare instructions provided by your medical provider

⚠ What to avoid

- Pressing or massaging the injection sites
- Spending time in saunas or high-heat environments
- Evaluating results based solely on early swelling

## 🕑 Week 2 (Day 8–14)

### Swelling subsides and contour changes become more noticeable

By the second week, swelling and tenderness gradually decrease, and changes are often felt through clothing fit or texture rather than visual appearance alone. Fat-dissolving injections respond at different speeds depending on the area treated, while muscle-targeting injections gradually create a tightening effect. These treatments typically show progressive improvement rather than immediate completion.

✔ Helpful tips

- Focus on changes in silhouette rather than body weight
- Resume light physical activity as tolerated
- Ensure sufficient water and protein intake
- Organize follow-up or maintenance plans if needed

⚠ What to avoid

- Comparing size or shape changes on a daily basis
- Combining multiple treatments within a short period
- Expecting instant or final results at this stage

### Physician's note

Fat-dissolving and body injections work in harmony with the body's metabolic process. Taking time to observe gradual changes, rather than rushing evaluation, leads to more natural and satisfying results.`,

(Applicable treatments: Botox Injections, Jawline Botox, Expression Line Botox, Shoulder Botox, Salivary Gland Botox, Dermal Fillers, Hyaluronic Acid Fillers, Forehead/Temple/Nasolabial Fold/Lip/Chin Fillers, Contour Fillers, Injection Corrections)

## 🕐 Week 1 (Day 0–7)

### Muscles and subcutaneous tissues begin responding to the injected agents

Injectable treatments generally involve minimal downtime, but internally, muscles and subcutaneous tissues actively respond to the injected substances. During this period, mild swelling, bruising, or tenderness may occur, and slight discomfort when pressed is normal. Botox does not take effect immediately; its action develops gradually over several days. Fillers may appear more pronounced right after the procedure, which is a temporary stage before they integrate with surrounding tissue.

✔ Helpful tips

- Keep injection sites clean
- Avoid lying down for extended periods on the day of treatment
- Manage bruising gently without excessive cooling
- Evaluate progress over several days rather than day by day

⚠ What to avoid

- Pressing or massaging injection sites
- Alcohol consumption or intense exercise on the day of treatment
- Making immediate judgments about results

## 🕑 Week 2 (Day 8–14)

### Effects stabilize and the final direction of results becomes clearer

By the second week, Botox effects stabilize and facial movements appear softer and more balanced. Fillers integrate more naturally with surrounding tissue, creating smoother and more refined contours. Any mild asymmetry or discomfort typically resolves during this phase.

✔ Helpful tips

- Reduce mirror-checking and assess overall facial balance
- Take photos using consistent expressions and angles
- Continue moisturization and sun protection
- Consult your provider if any concerns arise

⚠ What to avoid

- Adding injections based on self-assessment alone
- Excessive comparison with others' results
- Over-touching treated areas to check shape

### Physician's note

Injectable treatments are designed to settle naturally over time. Allowing sufficient time for stabilization before evaluation leads to more satisfying and balanced outcomes.`,

## 🕐 Week 1 (Day 0–7)

### The deeper layers of the skin begin responding to stimulation

Skin injections and skin boosters primarily affect the dermal layer rather than producing immediate surface changes. During this period, mild redness, swelling, pinpoint bruising, or slight stinging at injection sites may occur. Right after treatment, the skin may feel rough or appear overly glossy, which is a temporary state before the injected agents distribute evenly within the skin.

✔ Helpful tips

- Cleanse gently and keep skincare routines minimal
- Focus on intensive moisturization to protect the skin barrier
- Use sun protection consistently when outdoors
- Observe skin changes over several days rather than daily

⚠ What to avoid

- Rubbing or pressing injection sites
- Exfoliation or peeling treatments
- Saunas or intense exercise immediately after treatment

## 🕑 Week 2 (Day 8–14)

### Skin texture improves and inner hydration becomes noticeable

By the second week, redness and pinpoint bruising subside, and improvements in hydration, elasticity, and overall skin texture become more noticeable. Skin boosters are not designed as one-time treatments; their effects build gradually with repeated sessions. Many people notice enhanced glow and better makeup application during this stage.

✔ Helpful tips

- Evaluate results based on skin brightness and makeup adherence
- Take photos under consistent lighting and angles
- Continue moisturization and sun protection
- Review treatment intervals for future sessions

⚠ What to avoid

- Rushing into additional treatments for faster results
- Overanalyzing daily skin condition changes
- Reintroducing strong or irritating skincare products too soon

## 🕐 Week 1 (Day 0–7)

### Both the skin surface and deeper layers respond to laser stimulation

Laser and light-based treatments deliver energy to both the skin surface and underlying tissue. During this phase, redness, warmth, stinging, dryness, or mild swelling may occur. Depending on the procedure, the skin may temporarily appear uneven in tone or feel more sensitive. These reactions are part of the skin's natural regeneration process and do not reflect the final outcome.

✔ Helpful tips

- Prioritize moisturization to protect the skin barrier
- Apply sun protection consistently when outdoors
- Keep cleansing and skincare routines gentle
- Observe changes over several days rather than daily

⚠ What to avoid

- Exfoliation or peeling treatments
- Saunas, steam rooms, or high-heat environments
- Judging results based solely on redness or dryness

## 🕑 Week 2 (Day 8–14)

### Redness subsides and improvements in tone and texture emerge

By the second week, redness and sensitivity gradually decrease, and the overall skin tone appears more even. Pore visibility and skin texture also begin to improve, often felt as smoother skin to the touch. Laser treatments are designed to produce cumulative benefits with repeated sessions rather than instant perfection.

✔ Helpful tips

- Take photos under consistent natural lighting
- Evaluate progress based on texture and makeup application
- Continue moisturization and sun protection
- Confirm intervals for future treatment sessions

⚠ What to avoid

- Comparing skin tone changes on a daily basis
- Combining multiple intensive treatments too closely
- Introducing new or irritating skincare products too soon

## 🕐 Week 1 (Day 0–7)

### Inflammatory response remains as the skin prioritizes repair

Acne, pore, and scar treatments target already sensitive skin, making redness, stinging, and mild swelling more noticeable during this phase. After treating inflammatory acne, redness may temporarily appear more pronounced, which reflects an active healing response rather than worsening. The current skin condition represents a recovery phase, not treatment failure.

✔ Helpful tips

- Cleanse gently to minimize irritation
- Maintain consistent moisturization to protect the skin barrier
- Use sun protection at all times
- Assess changes over several days rather than daily

⚠ What to avoid

- Picking scabs or peeling skin forcefully
- Touching or squeezing acne lesions
- Judging treatment success based solely on inflammation

## 🕑 Week 2 (Day 8–14)

### Redness subsides and surface texture begins to improve

By the second week, redness and sensitivity gradually decrease, and pores and surface irregularities start to smooth out. For acne scars and atrophic scars, visible changes develop slowly while collagen regeneration continues beneath the skin. This stage is about confirming improvement direction rather than final results.

✔ Helpful tips

- Take photos under consistent natural lighting
- Focus on texture and makeup application improvements
- Continue low-irritation skincare routines
- Follow prescribed oral or topical medications as directed

⚠ What to avoid

- Comparing redness or texture changes daily
- Adding aggressive cosmetic procedures too soon
- Resuming exfoliation prematurely

## 🕒 Week 3 (Day 15–21)

### Skin regeneration progresses and improvements become noticeable

During the third week, skin stability improves, and acne flare-ups and redness decrease. Improvements in pore appearance and scarring are often noticed through smoother texture rather than dramatic visual changes. Multiple sessions are often required, and this phase represents ongoing recovery and regeneration.

✔ Helpful tips

- Evaluate progress on a monthly basis
- Maintain a regular sleep schedule to support skin balance
- Continue sun protection and moisturization
- Discuss future treatment plans with your provider

⚠ What to avoid

- Expecting immediate or complete correction
- Adjusting treatment frequency without medical guidance
- Layering additional procedures before stabilization

Peeling and exfoliation treatments remove accumulated dead skin cells to support healthy skin turnover. During this phase, the skin may feel more sensitive, dry, or tight, and mild redness or flaking can occur. Any peeling should be allowed to resolve naturally without manual removal. Even if the skin appears unstable, this stage represents preparation for renewal rather than damage.

✔ Helpful tips

- Prioritize moisturization to maintain skin hydration
- Apply sun protection consistently when outdoors
- Use gentle, low-irritation cleansers
- Monitor skin condition over several days

⚠ What to avoid

- Peeling or picking flaking skin
- Using harsh scrubs or irritating skincare products
- Saunas or intense physical activity

## 🕑 Week 2 (Day 8–14)

### Skin stabilizes and smoothness becomes noticeable

By the second week, sensitivity gradually subsides, and improvements in skin texture and brightness become more apparent. Pores may feel cleaner, and makeup application often improves. Peeling and exfoliation treatments are best maintained through regular, appropriately spaced sessions.

✔ Helpful tips

- Evaluate changes based on texture and makeup performance
- Continue moisturization and sun protection
- Take photos under consistent conditions
- Plan the timing of future maintenance treatments

⚠ What to avoid

- Repeating peels too frequently
- Over-exfoliating the skin
- Overanalyzing minor daily fluctuations

### Physician's note

Peeling and exfoliation treatments are most effective when performed gently and consistently. Respecting the skin's recovery cycle helps maintain balanced, healthy skin over time.`,
